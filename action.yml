inputs:
  files-to-judge:
    description: |
      Space-separated list of files to judge. Globs are supported.
      @see https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob#patterns
      for details on supported patterns.

      NOTE: Since GitHub Actions support only string input values, using YAML's
      `>-` string syntax is recommended for readability.
      @see https://yaml-multiline.info
    required: false

  do-this-in-response:
    description: |
      If no meaningful changes to the monitored file(s) are detected, this
      action can respond in one or more predefined ways. By default, this
      action simply fails, catering to the use-case of blocking PRs containing
      meaningless changes.

      NOTE: This is a JSON object string, not a YAML map. GitHub Actions do
      not currently support any input types other than strings.

      NOTE: Many of these reactions are only applicable to `pull-request`
      events, but some, like `fail`, are event-agnostic. If a reaction is
      specified but not applicable to an event, it has no effect.

      Supported reactions:
        - `comment` (string)
          If provided, this comment will be left on the PR.

          The following patterns are interpolated:
            `%(files)`
            The same space-separated list of filenames output by this action

            `%(filesAsMarkdownList)`:
             A valid unordered Markdown list of the items in `files`

          Ex.
             "The changes you made to these files are meaningless:\n%(filesAsMarkdownList)\nDid you mean to touch them?"
          -->
             The changes you made to these files are meaningless:
             - foo.py
             - src/config/bar.json
             - docs/dontreadme.md
             Did you intend to touch them?

        - `alert` (array of strings)
          If provided, these users/aliases will be pinged in a comment. These
          will be combined with any given `comment` or otherwise
          given a comment of their own.

        - `fail` (boolean)
          Default: true
          If provided, this action will fail if no meaningful changes to the
          monitored are detected.
    required: false
    default: |
      { "fail": true }
outputs:
  files:
    description: |
      A space-separated string of file paths, relative to the project root,
      that comprise whatever subset of the input `files-to-judge` were changed
      in meaningless ways in the event that triggered the action.
