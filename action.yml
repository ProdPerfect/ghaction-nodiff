inputs:
  files-to-judge:
    description: |
      Optional space-separated list of files to judge. Globs are supported.
      @see https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/glob#patterns
      for details on supported patterns.

      NOTE: Since GitHub Actions support only string input values, using YAML's
      `>-` string syntax is recommended for readability.
      @see https://yaml-multiline.info
    required: false

  respond-with:
    description: |
      If no meaningful changes to the monitored file(s) are detected, this
      action can respond in one or more predefined ways. By default, this
      action simply fails, catering to the use-case of blocking PRs containing
      meaningless changes.

      NOTE: This is a JSON object string, not a YAML map. GitHub Actions do
      not currently support any input types other than strings.

      NOTE: Many of these reactions are only applicable to `pull-request`
      events, but some, like `fail`, are event-agnostic. If a reaction is
      specified but not applicable to an event, it has no effect.

      Supported reactions:
        - `comment` (string)
          If provided, a review will be submitted with this comment.
          If `fail` is also specified, the review will request changes.

          The following patterns are interpolated:
            `%(files)`
            The same space-separated list of filenames output by this action

            `%(filesAsMarkdownList)`:
             A valid unordered Markdown list of the items in `files`

          Ex.
             "The changes you made to these files are meaningless:\n%(filesAsMarkdownList)\nDid you mean to touch them?"
          -->
             The changes you made to these files are meaningless:
             - foo.py
             - src/config/bar.json
             - docs/dontreadme.md
             Did you intend to touch them?

        - `requestReviewers` (array of strings)
          If provided, these users/aliases will be requested to leave a review.

        - `fail` (boolean)
          Default: true
          If provided, this action will fail if no meaningful changes to the
          monitored files are detected.
          If `comment` is also specfied, the submitted review will request
          changes, not just leave a comment.
    required: false
    default: |
      { "fail": true }
  github-token:
    description: |
      A properly provisioned access token required when you wish to request
      reviewers or comment on the associated pull request.
      This can simply be the `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` implicitly provided to your
      GitHub Workflow.
    required: true
outputs:
  files:
    description: |
      A space-separated string of file paths, relative to the project root,
      that comprise whatever subset of the input `files-to-judge` were changed
      in meaningless ways in the event that triggered the action.
  filesAsMarkdownList:
    description: |
      The same as the `files` output, but using the string "\n- " as the
      delimeter between file paths instead of a space.
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'dist/index.js'
